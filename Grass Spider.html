<h1>Requirements</h1>
<p>
I want a computer that can run games, movies, and one that I am able to do homework on. It needs to be able to connect to the internet and have atleast a 14" display. The perhiperals I would need are headphones, keyboard, mouse, maybe a monitor, or anything else the computer doesn't come with. I want the RAM to be atleast 8gb and the computer to have a storage of atleast 1TB.

	<tr>
  	  <td> The ALIENWARE is a laptop while the Dell is a desktop. This means I would be able to bring the ALIENWARE wherever I go and bring it to school. It also comes with a keyboard already on it and a touchpad. </td>
	  <td> The Dell desktop is $1000 dollars less expensive which is a big factor and a lot of money. </td>
	  <td> The processors are very close but the ALIENWARE has a little bit faster if a processor. </td>	
	  <td> They Both run Windows 10 Home 64 ENG which is the most up to date version of windows. </td>	
	  <td> The graphics card is one of the major things for gaming and movie watching, the ALIENWARE has a better graphics card which could be crucial for playing games or watching movies. </td>	
	  <td> The RAM of the ALIENWARE is 800 MHz's better which can seem like a lot but won't make a huge difference. </td>
	  <td> The hard drive of the Desktop carries 1TB more which is double the memory of the ALIENWARE. This is a key component of the computer but I think 1TB should be enough, and if it isn't I would be able to get a portable hard drive.</td>
	  <td> The laptop comes with everything I need but for the desktop I would have to get a monitor and speakers (if I want to have music play out loud). Since I already have a monitor and speakers I won't need to buy anything extra for the desktop. </td>
	  <td> Both computers are able to connect to the internet and bluetooth, with the desktop I would have a larger display as my monitor at home is 24", but I would be able to connect it with my laptop and use it as a second screen. I would also have to continuously charge my laptop unlike my desktop that would just stay plugged in the whole time. </td>

	<h2> Overall </h2>
<p> Overall the ALIENWARE has a slightly better processor, a better graphics card, and slightly better memory, while the Dell desktop has a much better price and hard drive. If I had to pick which computer I would get I would chose the Dell desktop because even though it's a desktop and I wouldn't be able to take it everywhere I go, it compares so closely with the laptop, and for such a big price difference, I don't think it is worth getting the ALIENWARE. </p>
