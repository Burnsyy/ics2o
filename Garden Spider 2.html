    <h1> Installing Applications </h1>
  <p> Now that you have internet connection, you can setup some of the applications you want on your computer. I will show you multiple ways of installing the applications you want. I will show you how to setup three applications as examples. I chose Netlfix so I can watch movies and TV shows on my computer and McAfee so that my computer would be protected against viruses. </p>
