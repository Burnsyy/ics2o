    <h1> Installing Applications </h1>
  <p> Now that you have internet connection, you can setup some of the applications you want on your computer. I will show you how to setup three applications as examples. I chose Skype so I could talk to my family who don't live near me, McAfee so that my computer would be protected against viruses, and Notepad++ so I can work on my websites on my computer. </p>
