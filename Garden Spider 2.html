    <h1> Installing Applications </h1>
  <p> Now that you have internet connection, you can set up some of the applications you want on your computer. I will show you multiple ways of installing the applications you want. I will show you how to setup two applications as examples. I choose Netflix so I can watch movies and TV shows on my computer and McAfee so that my computer would be protected against viruses. </p>
    <h2> Installing McAfee (using the website) </h2>
    <ul class="b"> 
      <li> Go to google and search 'https://www.mcafee.com' in the navigation bar </li>      
      <li> On the website, choose 'For Consumers' under the 'Select Your Security Solution' bar </li>
      <li> On this page, scroll down and pick the package you want based on your needs and select 'Buy Now' to purchase that product </li>
      <li> Once you have selected the package you want, fill in the needed information under Account and Billing Info </li>
      <li> Once you have filled in the needed information click the 'Agree and Continue' button </li>
      <li> Now complete the McAfee installation wizard by agreeing to the term of service and selecting where you would like the McAfee program to be in your computer</li>
      <li> Now click 'Install', you now have McAfee Virus Protection on your computer </li>
  </ul>
